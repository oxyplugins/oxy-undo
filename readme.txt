Adds the missing undo and redo functionality in the Oxygen builder.

== Description ==

This plugin adds the missing undo and redo functionality in the Oxygen builder.

A few sample use cases:

* Undoing moving elements around in the Structure Panel or accidental drag and drop actions in the main center frame.
* Undoing the action of linking a selected text in Text component.
* Recovering the text deleted from components like Text and Progress Bar which is otherwise not possible.
* Creating re-usable parts from an element and continue to edit the element by immediately pressing the Undo button. The reusable part can be found in the Templates list.
* Recovering an accidental deletion of a condition.
